{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9083fd","input":"The most basic `matplotlib` plotting command is `plot`. The simplest form of plot takes two arguments, a list (or a numpy array) `[x0, x1, ...]` of x-coordinates and a list (or numpy array) `[y0, y1, ...]` of y-coordinates.  It draws a straight line from `(x0, y0)` to `(x1, y1)`, a straight line from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)`, and so on.  In the plot above, the two argumets are `[0, 1, 2]` and `[1, 2, 1]` so the line goes from `(0,1)` to `(1, 2)` to `(2,1)`.\n\nWe can use `plot` to draw graphs of functions.  If we want the graph of $y = f(x)$ between $x=a$ and $x=b$ we need to generate a list `[x0, x1, ..., xN]` of x-values with `x0 = a` and `xN = b` and another list `[f(x0), f(x1), ..., f(xN)]` giving the y-coordinates.  So long as we choose `N` large enough (and so long as $f$ is nice enough) this should look like the graph of $y=f(x)$.\n\nLet's plot $y= \\sin(x)$ for $0 \\leq x \\leq 2 \\pi$.  There are lots of ways to produce a list of x-coordinates, but the easiest is to use numpy's `linspace(a, b, N)` command which returns an array of shape `(N,)` consisting of `N` equally spaced points starting at `a` and ending at `b`.
