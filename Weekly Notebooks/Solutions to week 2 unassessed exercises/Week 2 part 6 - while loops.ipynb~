    "A while loop is like a for loop - the same piece of code gets executed again and again - but instead of stopping after a fixed number of times, a while loop keeps going until a certain condition is no longer met.  (In other words, it keeps going *while* the condition is true - hence the name).  After that execution continues with the next line indented the same as the `while` statement.\n",

    "The fact that a while loop can run an unbounded amount of times means that while loops are \"more powerful\" than for loops.  This comes with a drawback: it's easy to write a while loop that will run forever.  For example, if your while loop started `while True:` then the condition would always be true and it seems as if the loop would never stop.\n",
    "There is a way around this: in while loop (or a for loop) you can use the `break` keyword to get out of the loop.  When Python sees `break` it jumps to the next piece of code after the loop.\n",
