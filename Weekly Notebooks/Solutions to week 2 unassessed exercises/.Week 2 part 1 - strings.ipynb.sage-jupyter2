We use different types to represent different kinds of data, for example numbers can be `int`s or `floats`s, text is represented by `str` (short for *string*), truth or falsity is represented by the `bool` (boolean) type, and there are many more.\n\nYou can find out what the type of an object is using the `type` function:","pos":0,"type":"cell"}

The `input` function lets us do that.\n\n`input` takes a single string argument and prints that out, then waits for the user to type something in and press enter.  It returns what the user typed **as a string**.  This means that `a = input(\"hello\")`, for example, will print out the message `hello`, wait for the user to type something and press enter, then assign what they typed to the variable `a` which will have type `str`.\n\nRead the code in the next cell and before you run it, try to work out what it will do.
