You can read more about NumPy [on their homepage](https://numpy.org/).\n\nNumPy is a Python module which has functions for working with vectors and matrices (and higher-dimensional arrays) and for working with random numbers.  [Here is a link to the documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/).\n\nOf course, if we wanted we could represent matrices and vectors using lists in plain Python and write functions to do matrix multiplication, vector addition, and so on. The advantage of NumPy  is that all this code has been written and tested for us by experts in numerical linear algebra.  The big number of high-quality, popular, and freely available modules for mathematical computing is one reason you're learning Python instead of another computer language.\n\nYou often see NumPy imported using `import numpy as np`.  As you saw in the previous notebook this just saves a bit of typing: after doing this you can use `np.functionName` instead of `numpy.functionName`.\n\n## NumPy arrays\n\nThe most important object NumPy provides is the `array`.  These are rectangular grids of numbers which you can use to represent matrices and vectors.  The easiest way to create arrays is by using `np.array()` with the argument being a list of the rows of the matrix or vector you want to create, each row being a list of its entries.","pos":0,"type":"cell"}
