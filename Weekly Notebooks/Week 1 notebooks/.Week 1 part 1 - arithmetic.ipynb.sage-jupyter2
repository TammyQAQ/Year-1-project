Click the link to learn more, or just click the \"Chat\" button at the top on the right.\n\nThere are also unassessed exercises in this folder which don't count toward your module mark, but will help you understand the course material.  They won't be marked. Solutions will be published after the week is over.\n\n## Jupyter notebooks\n\nThe file you are looking at is called a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).  It's a convenient place to experiment with Python code, as well as a very popular environment for doing data analysis.  You can save any changes you make to this notebook with the green Save button at the top left of the screen.\n\nA *code cell* in a Jupyter notebook is one of the boxes with `In `[` `]`:` to its left.
