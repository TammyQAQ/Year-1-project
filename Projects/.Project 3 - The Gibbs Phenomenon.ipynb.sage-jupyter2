{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"12dca3","input":"You are familiar with the fact that power series don't always converge - that's why you spend so much time in Analysis 1 thinking about radii of convergence.  Fourier series also have interesting convergence behaviour.  Your plots should show a special behaviour of Fourier series called the *Gibbs phenomenon*, where the partial sums are larger than the value of `square_wave(x)` for values of $x$ near to where `square_wave(x)` jumps from positive to negative.  In the next exercise you will investigate exactly how large is the difference between the partial sums and the square wave.","pos":8,"type":"cell"}

You don't need to have any previous knowledge of Fourier series (which are covered in [Methods 3](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/maths/sites/maths/files/math0016.pdf) next year) to complete this project.\n\nIn your analysis modules you looked at power series representations for functions - for example, you can represent the function $f(x) = e^x$ by a series\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty \\frac{x^i}{i!}.$$\nA power series for a function $f$ expresses $f(x)$ as a sum of multiples of powers of $x$.  Fourier series are similar, but they represent functions as sums of multiples of functions of the form $\\sin(nx)$ and $\\cos(mx)$.\n\n\n\nThe first cell below imports some functions that you will need for plotting.","pos":1,"type":"cell"}
