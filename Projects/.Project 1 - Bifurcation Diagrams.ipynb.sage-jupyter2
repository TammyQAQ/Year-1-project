This allows the iterations to settle down to a cycle, if they're going to.

Given lists `xs = [a0, a1, a2,...]` of x-coordinates and `ys = [b0, b1, b2, ...]` of y-coordinates, `plt.scatter(xs, ys)` plots the points with coordinates `(a0, b0), (a1, b1), ...`.  You may need to use `plt.scatter(xs, ys, s = e, marker='.')` where `e` is some small number to get the plot looking good.\n - Experiment to see what looks best! Read the [`plt.scatter` documentation](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.scatter.html) and try different options, change `L`, `M`, and `N`, ...\n - Start with smaller values of `L, M, N` so that the code runs quickly, and increase them when you're confident everything works correctly.\n - **Important.** Only call `plt.scatter` **once** - you should generate all of the points in your plot, then use `plt.scatter` to plot them.  If you call `plt.scatter` lots of times, your code will take a long time to run.","pos":10,"type":"cell"}

We'd like to check whether $y_0$ is $m$-periodic for some $m$, but because of rounding errors we can't expect $y_0$ to be exactly equal to $f^{\\circ m}(y_0)$.  For this reason we'll relax our definition a bit by allowing $f^{\\circ m}(y_0)$ to be within $\\epsilon$ of $y_0$, where $\\epsilon$ is some small number.\n\nWrite a function `periodicity(y0, f, epsilon, max_iter)` which takes as input a number $y_0$, a function $f$, a number $\\epsilon$, and a positive whole number `max_iter`, and returns the smallest $m$ such that \n\n$$ | y_0 - f^{\\circ m}(y_0) | < \\epsilon $$\n\nif there is such an $m$ less than `max_iter`.

You will see that as $\\gamma$ increases the behaviour of the sequence $(x_n)$ changes in an interesting way.  For $\\gamma$ less than about 5, the sequence $x_n$ converges: e.g. if $\\gamma=4$ then\n$$ x_n \\to 0.9729550\\cdots \\textrm{ as } n \\to \\infty.$$\n\nWhen $5.1\\leq \\gamma \\leq 8$ the sequence doesn't converge to a limit, but instead tends to cycle between two values. For example, if $\\gamma=6$ then\n\n$$ x_{1000} = 0.6913336\\cdots, x_{1001} = 1.6640204\\cdots, x_{1002} = 0.6913336\\cdots, x_{1003} = 1.6640204\\cdots$$\n\nAs $\\gamma$ increases the limiting behaviour becomes a cycle of 4 values, then of 8, then 16, and so on. For gamma around 9.4 stops tending to a cycle at all and becomes completely non-periodic, but there are larger values of $\\gamma$ at which the sequence again tends to a cycle.\n\nA [**bifurcation diagram**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_diagram) is a diagram which summarises this behaviour.
